# Esprit 2: Heart & Soul

This is a sequel to Esprit for the Game Boy.

# Project Goals
- A more in-depth character system.
- Longer story
- Larger/more dungeons.
- Even more dynamic cutscenes.
- Persistent worldgen. (dungeons are always the same in each game)
- Dungeons are all interconnected. (with a worldmap provided for quickly hopping between them)
- Magic system (No silly "moves"! This isn't Pokemon.)
- Freeplay/"Crawl mode" where you can make a character and play with no story.
